"""Pluggable storage for offloaded tool results.

When a context policy offloads a large tool result it keeps only a short marker
in the per-call view and, when a store is configured, writes the full output to
a :class:`ResultStore` that the policy's recall tool reads back by the marker's
reference — a **content digest**, because the store is shared across sessions
while call_ids are session-local (see
:class:`~lovia.context.state.OffloadRecord.digest`).
The store is owned by the *policy*, not the runner, so the context layer never
depends on the workspace (or any runner-provided capability) just to archive a
result.

Today the full output also stays in the transcript, so recall can fall back to
it: a store miss — or an ephemeral :class:`InMemoryResultStore` lost on restart
— degrades gracefully rather than erroring. That fallback is not a guarantee,
though: a clearing policy may later evict outputs from the transcript, and a
durable store is what keeps them recoverable. So the store is a cache *while*
the transcript retains everything and a durability backstop *once it does not*.
There is deliberately **no** ``delete``/eviction on the protocol — a backend
that wants a bound enforces one internally (see :class:`InMemoryResultStore`) —
and selective/partial reads are likewise left out until a concrete need lands;
both are non-breaking to add later.
